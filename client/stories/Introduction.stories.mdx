## Notes

### Color in this Documentation

For context, review how color is handled in this sytem.

Storybook's controls are very limited and do not allow for nesting, cascading,
etc. I've experimented with handling color kind, tone, level, and alpha as
separate properties, as demonstrated in the
[Storybook documentation re: handling complex values
](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/essentials/controls#dealing-with-complex-values).
While this worked just fine initially, when a Storybook page was reloaded, the
level control would not take its value from the URL parameter. Furthermore, it
was still very easy to set the controls to specify colors that do not exist in
this design system's color scheme.

It's also possible to use a ColorPicker control and even [
specify a set of color swatches for this
control](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/essentials/controls#specify-initial-preset-color-swatches).
However, among other issues, this misrepresents the components' actual API.

If I decide to change the API for specifying colors to something simpler, such
as a flat list of available colors, then I may choose to add a color control.
